# Release notes
## 1.1.1
* Fixed issue where loading multiple saves on the same game instance (not closed and restarted) would give the player multiple objects of the same item when only a single object was taken from a chest and placed in the inventory.
* In some cases the in-game "museum-item placement" bug wasn't fixed. This has been addressed.
* Added Spanish translation (thanks to user "igoutta" from nexusmods).

## 1.1
* Lost Books can now be "grabbed & sent" to the library even when the player's inventory has no free space.
* Added Chinese translation (thanks to user "FarAways" from nexusmods).
* Added German language support.

## 1.0 (Initial Release)
