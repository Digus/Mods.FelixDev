**Archaeology House Content Management Helper** is a [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/) mod that is aimed at improving 
the management of the Library/Museum. It provides status information about found books and contributed items and improves 
management of museum pieces. It largely fixes the in-game bug preventing item placement in certain cases and allows 
item rearrangement even if you have nothing to donate. 

Furthermore, to help the user bringing structure into his museum pieces arrangement, each selected item will display a tooltip 
showing detailed item information. To make rearrangement less tedious, items can be directly swapped with each other and 
gamepad cursors can now also be used to select an item (instead of only being usable when an item is selected). 

Lost Books can now be "grabbed & sent" to the library even if the user's inventory is full. No longer will the user have to make space for a book which it doesn't occupy anyway and leaves the user with an empty slot in the inventory.

Also fixes some small bugs in the original game (such as pressing the 'Ok' button next to the inventory will select the item 
beneath it instead of exiting the menu).
